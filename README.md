# gardener-extension-otelcol

The `gardener-extension-otelcol` repo provides a Gardener Extension for an
OpenTelemetry Collector, which runs in the shoot control-plane namespace and
forwards observability signals for control-plane components to a remote
OpenTelemetry Collector receiver.

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is in early development state. Do not use it in a production environment.

# Usage

You can enable the extension for a [Gardener Shoot
cluster](https://gardener.cloud/docs/glossary/_index#gardener-glossary) by
updating the `.spec.extensions` of your shoot manifest.

The following example shoot manifest snippet enables the extension and
configures the OpenTelemetry Collector to emit the signals for the shoot
control-plane components via the
[Debug Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/debugexporter).

``` yaml
...

spec:
  extensions:
    - type: otelcol
      providerConfig:
        apiVersion: otelcol.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
        kind: CollectorConfig
        spec:
          exporters:
            debug:
              enabled: true
              verbosity: basic  # basic, normal or detailed
```

This configuration however is only useful while developing or troubleshooting an
issue with the collector, because signals are not actually forwarded to a remote
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) receiver.

The following configuration snippet enables the extension for a shoot and
configures it to forward the signals of the control-plane components to a remote
collector using the
[OTLP HTTP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter).

``` yaml
...

spec:
  extensions:
    - type: otelcol
      providerConfig:
        apiVersion: otelcol.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
        kind: CollectorConfig
        spec:
          exporters:
            # OTLP HTTP exporter settings
            otlphttp:
              enabled: true
              endpoint: "https://opentelemetry-receiver.example.org"
```

The following example snippet expands on the previous one by adding
[TLS configuration settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md) and
[Bearer token authentication](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/bearertokenauthextension) with the remote collector.

``` yaml
...

spec:
  extensions:
    - type: otelcol
      providerConfig:
        apiVersion: otelcol.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
        kind: CollectorConfig
        spec:
          exporters:
            # OTLP HTTP exporter settings
            otlphttp:
              enabled: true
              endpoint: "https://opentelemetry-receiver.example.org"
              token:
                resourceRef:
                  name: otelcol-bearer-token
                  dataKey: token
              tls:
                ca:
                  resourceRef:
                    name: otelcol-tls
                    dataKey: ca.crt
                cert:
                  resourceRef:
                    name: otelcol-tls
                    dataKey: client.crt
                key:
                  resourceRef:
                    name: otelcol-tls
                    dataKey: client.key
  resources:
  - name: otelcol-bearer-token
    resourceRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      name: my-otelcol-bearer-token
  - name: otelcol-tls
    resourceRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      name: my-otelcol-tls
```

In order to provide the `otelcol-tls` and `otelcol-bearer-token` secrets from
the example above to the extension, you should first create the respective
secrets in the shoot project namespace, which can then be referenced via
[Gardener Referenced Resources](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/extensions/referenced-resources/#referenced-resources).

For additional configuration settings, which can be provided to the extension,
please make sure to check the
[OTel Extension API spec documentation](./docs/api-reference/otelcol.extensions.gardener.cloud.md).

# Development

In order to build a binary of the extension, you can use the following command.

``` shell
make build
```

The resulting binary can be found in `bin/extension`.

In order to build a Docker image of the extension, you can use the following
command.

``` shell
make docker-build
```

For local development of the `gardener-extension-otelcol` it is recommended that
you setup a [development Gardener environment](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/local_setup/).

Please refer to the next sections for more information about deploying and
testing the extension in a Gardener development environment.

## Development Environment without Gardener Operator

The following documents describe how to create a Gardener development
environment locally. Please make sure to read them in order to familiarize
yourself with the setup, and also to install any prerequisites.

- [Gardener: Local setup requirements](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/local_setup/)
- [Gardener: Getting Started Locally](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/deployment/getting_started_locally/)

The steps from this section describe how to deploy and develop the extension
against a local development environment, without the
[Gardener Operator](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/operator/).

In summary, these are the steps you need to follow in order to start a local
development Gardener environment, however, please make sure that you read the
documents above for additional details.

``` shell
make kind-up gardener-up
```

Before you continue with the next steps, make sure that you configure your
`KUBECONFIG` to point to the kubeconfig file created by Gardener for you.

This file will be located in the
`/path/to/gardener/example/gardener-local/kind/local/kubeconfig` path after
creating the dev environment.

``` shell
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/gardener/example/gardener-local/kind/local/kubeconfig
```

In the [examples/dev-setup](./examples/dev-setup) directory you can find
[kustomize](https://kustomize.io/]) resources, which can be used to create the
`ControllerDeployment` and `ControllerRegistration` resources.

For more information about `ControllerDeployment` and `ControllerRegistration`
resources, please make sure to check the
[Registering Extension Controllers](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/extensions/registration/)
documentation.

The `deploy` target takes care of deploying your extension in a local Gardener
environment. It does the following.

1. Builds a Docker image of the extension
2. Loads the image into the `kind` cluster nodes
3. Packages the Helm charts and pushes them to the local registry
4. Deploys the `ControllerDeployment` and `ControllerRegistration` resources

``` shell
make deploy
```

Verify that we have successfully created the `ControllerDeployment` and
`ControllerRegistration` resources.

``` shell
$ kubectl get controllerregistrations,controllerdeployments otelcol
NAME                                                 RESOURCES           AGE
controllerregistration.core.gardener.cloud/otelcol   Extension/otelcol   108s

NAME                                               AGE
controllerdeployment.core.gardener.cloud/otelcol   108s
```

Finally, we can create an example shoot with our extension enabled. The
[examples/shoot.yaml](./examples/shoot.yaml) file provides a ready-to-use shoot
manifest with the extension enabled and configured.

The provided example shoot references secrets from the project namespace, which
are used to configure the TLS settings between the exporter and a local dev
receiver, running in the `default` namespace.

The following command will create the TLS secrets, a dev OpenTelemetry receiver
in the `default` namespace, and a dev shoot, configured with the extension.

``` shell
make create-dev-shoot
```

If you have an already existing and running shoot, for which you want to enable
the extension, simply follow the instructions from the previous section in order
to enable and configure the extension manually.

Once we create the shoot cluster, `gardenlet` will start deploying our
`gardener-extension-otelcol`, since it is required by our shoot.

Verify that the extension has been successfully installed by checking the
corresponding `ControllerInstallation` resource.

``` shell
$ kubectl get controllerinstallations
NAME                      REGISTRATION        SEED    VALID   INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PROGRESSING   AGE
otelcol-clnw7             otelcol             local   True    True        True      False         91s
```

After your shoot cluster has been successfully created and reconciled, verify
that the extension resource in the shoot control-plane namespace is healthy.

``` shell
$ kubectl --namespace shoot--local--local get extensions
NAME      TYPE      STATUS      AGE
otelcol   otelcol   Succeeded   85m
```

Verify that the
[ManagedResource](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/resource-manager/)
created by the extension is healthy as well.

``` shell
$ kubectl --namespace shoot--local--local get managedresource external-otelcol
NAME               CLASS   APPLIED   HEALTHY   PROGRESSING   AGE
external-otelcol   seed    True      True      False         2m7s
```

After successful reconciliation we should see the following OpenTelemetry
collectors in the shoot control-plane namespace.

``` shell
$ kubectl --namespace shoot--local--local get otelcol external-otelcol
NAME                      MODE          VERSION   READY   AGE     IMAGE                                                                                                                          MANAGEMENT
external-otelcol          statefulset   0.141.0   1/1     6m45s   europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases/3rd/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.141.0   managed
```

We should also see that the Collector and Target Allocator are running and are
healthy.

``` shell
$ kubectl --namespace shoot--local--local get sts external-otelcol-collector
NAME                         READY   AGE
external-otelcol-collector   1/1     8m34s

$ kubectl --namespace shoot--local--local get deployment external-otelcol-targetallocator
NAME                               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
external-otelcol-targetallocator   1/1     1            1           8m40s
```

In order to trigger reconciliation of the extension you can annotate the
extension resource.

``` shell
kubectl --namespace shoot--local--local annotate extensions otelcol gardener.cloud/operation=reconcile
```

In order to delete the dev shoot, TLS secrets and dev OpenTelemetry receiver you
can run the following command.

``` shell
make delete-dev-shoot
```

## Development Environment with Gardener Operator

The extension can also be deployed via the
[Gardener Operator](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/operator/).

In order to start a local development environment with the Gardener Operator,
please refer to the following documentations.

- [Gardener Operator](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/operator/)
- [Gardener: Local setup with gardener-operator](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/deployment/getting_started_locally/#alternative-way-to-set-up-garden-and-seed-leveraging-gardener-operator)

In summary, these are the steps you need to follow in order to start a local
development environment with the [Gardener Operator](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/operator/),
however, please make sure that you read the documents above for additional details.

``` shell
make kind-multi-zone-up operator-up operator-seed-up
```

Before you continue with the next steps, make sure that you configure your
`KUBECONFIG` to point to the kubeconfig file of the cluster, which runs the
Gardener Operator.

There will be two kubeconfig files created for you, after the dev environment
has been created.

| Path                                                                  | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/path/to/gardener/example/gardener-local/kind/multi-zone/kubeconfig` | Cluster in which `gardener-operator` runs (a.k.a _runtime_ cluster) |
| `/path/to/gardener/dev-setup/kubeconfigs/virtual-garden/kubeconfig`   | The _virtual_ garden cluster                                        |

Throughout this document we will refer to the kubeconfigs for _runtime_ and
_virtual_ clusters as `$KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME` and `$KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL`
respectively.

Before deploying the extension we need to target the _runtime_ cluster, since
this is where the extension resources for `gardener-operator` reside.

``` shell
export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME
```

In order to deploy the extension, execute the following command.

``` shell
make deploy-operator
```

The `deploy-operator` target takes care of the following.

1. Builds a Docker image of the extension
2. Loads the image into the `kind` cluster nodes
3. Packages the Helm charts and pushes them to the local registry
4. Deploys the `Extension` (from group `operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1`) to
   the _runtime_ cluster

Verify that we have successfully created the
`Extension` (from group `operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1`) resource.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME get extop otelcol
NAME      INSTALLED   REQUIRED RUNTIME   REQUIRED VIRTUAL   AGE
otelcol   True        False              False              13s
```

Verify that the respective `ControllerRegistration` and `ControllerDeployment`
resources have been created by the `gardener-operator` in the _virtual_ garden
cluster.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL get controllerregistrations,controllerdeployments otelcol
NAME                                                 RESOURCES           AGE
controllerregistration.core.gardener.cloud/otelcol   Extension/otelcol   42s

NAME                                               AGE
controllerdeployment.core.gardener.cloud/otelcol   42s
```

Finally, we can create an example shoot with our extension enabled. The
[examples/shoot.yaml](./examples/shoot.yaml) file provides a ready-to-use shoot
manifest with the extension enabled and configured.

The provided example shoot references secrets from the project namespace, which
are used to configure the TLS settings between the exporter and a local dev
receiver, running in the `default` namespace.

The following commands will create the TLS secrets, a dev OpenTelemetry receiver
in the `default` namespace, and a dev shoot, configured with the extension.

``` shell
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME apply -f examples/opentelemetry-receiver.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL apply -f examples/secret-tls.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL apply -f examples/secret-bearer-token.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL apply -f examples/shoot.yaml
```

If you have an already existing and running shoot, for which you want to enable
the extension, simply follow the instructions from the previous sections in
order to enable and configure the extension manually.

Once we create the shoot cluster, `gardenlet` will start deploying our
`gardener-extension-otelcol`, since it is required by our shoot.

Verify that the extension has been successfully installed by checking the
corresponding `ControllerInstallation` resource for our extension.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL get controllerinstallations
NAME                      REGISTRATION        SEED    VALID   INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PROGRESSING   AGE
otelcol-8rvmn             otelcol             local   True    True        True      False         64s
```

After your shoot cluster has been successfully created and reconciled, verify
that the extension is healthy.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME --namespace shoot--local--local get extensions otelcol
NAME                INSTALLED   REQUIRED RUNTIME   REQUIRED VIRTUAL   AGE
otelcol             True        False              True               13m
```

Verify that the
[ManagedResource](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/concepts/resource-manager/)
created by the extension is healthy as well.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME --namespace shoot--local--local get managedresource external-otelcol
NAME               CLASS   APPLIED   HEALTHY   PROGRESSING   AGE
external-otelcol   seed    True      True      False         6m20s
```

After successful reconciliation we should see the following OpenTelemetry
collectors in the shoot control-plane namespace.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME --namespace shoot--local--local get otelcol external-otelcol
NAME                      MODE          VERSION   READY   AGE     IMAGE                                                                                                                          MANAGEMENT
external-otelcol          statefulset   0.141.0   1/1     6m45s   europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases/3rd/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.141.0   managed
```

We should also see that the Collector and Target Allocator are running and
healthy.

``` shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME --namespace shoot--local--local get sts external-otelcol-collector
NAME                         READY   AGE
external-otelcol-collector   1/1     3m30s

$ kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME --namespace shoot--local--local get deployment external-otelcol-targetallocator
NAME                               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
external-otelcol-targetallocator   1/1     1            1           3m38s
```

In order to trigger reconciliation of the extension you can annotate the
extension resource.

``` shell
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME --namespace shoot--local--local annotate extensions otelcol gardener.cloud/operation=reconcile
```

In order to delete the dev shoot, TLS secrets and dev OpenTelemetry receiver you
can run the following commands.

``` shell
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL --namespace garden-local annotate shoot local confirmation.gardener.cloud/deletion=true --overwrite
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL delete -f examples/shoot.yaml --ignore-not-found=true --wait=false
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME delete -f examples/opentelemetry-receiver.yaml --ignore-not-found=true --wait=false
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL delete -f examples/secret-tls.yaml --ignore-not-found=true --wait=false
kubectl --kubeconfig $KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL delete -f examples/secret-bearer-token.yaml --ignore-not-found=true --wait=false
```
